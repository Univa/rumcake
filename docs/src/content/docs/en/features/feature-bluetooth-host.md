:::caution
This feature is still a work in progress. For a list of features that still need
to be implemented, check the [to-do list](#to-do-list).
:::

This document contains information about how to make your keyboard communicate
with a host device over Bluetooth (LE).

# Setup

## Required Cargo features

You must enable the following `rumcake` features:

- `bluetooth`
- `nrf-ble` if you are using an nRF-based keyboard

:::danger
For nRF5x-based MCUs, the [`nrf-softdevice` crate](https://github.com/embassy-rs/nrf-softdevice) is used to implement bluetooth support.
Since `nrf-softdevice` has its own critical section implementation, **you must disable any other critical section implementation**.
For example, if you used one of the rumcake templates, you may have to remove `critical-section-single-core` from the `cortex-m` dependency:

```toml del={1} ins={2}
cortex-m = { version = "0.7.6", features = ["critical-section-single-core"] }
cortex-m = { version = "0.7.6" }
```

:::

## Required code

To set up your keyboard for bluetooth host communication, you must add `bluetooth` to your `#[keyboard]` macro invocation, and your keyboard must implement the `BluetoothKeyboard` and `BluetoothDevice` trait:

```rust ins={5,9-21}
use rumcake::keyboard;

#[keyboard(
    // somewhere in your keyboard macro invocation ...
    bluetooth
)]
struct MyKeyboard;

use rumcake::hw::platform::BluetoothDevice;
impl BluetoothDevice for WingpairLeft {
    // This addresses can be whatever you want, as long as it is a valid "Random Static" bluetooth addresses.
    // See "Random Static Address" in this link: https://novelbits.io/bluetooth-address-privacy-ble/
    const BLUETOOTH_ADDRESS: [u8; 6] = [0x41, 0x5A, 0xE3, 0x1E, 0x83, 0xE7]; // TODO: Change this
}

// Bluetooth configuration
use rumcake::bluetooth::BluetoothKeyboard;
impl BluetoothKeyboard for MyKeyboard {
    const BLE_VID: u16 = 0x0000; // Change this
    const BLE_PID: u16 = 0x0000; // Change this
}
```

:::tip
You can use Bluetooth and USB host communication on the same keyboard.

If you are using a template, USB should already be configured, but if you manually
set up your Cargo workspace, then see the docs for [USB host communication](../feature-usb-host/).

Also check the sections below for more information.
:::

# Keycodes

In your keyberon layout, you can use any of the enum members defined in `HardwareCommand`:

```rust
ToggleOutput
OutputUSB
OutputBluetooth
```

More information below.

## USB host communication interoperability

By default, your keyboard will use Bluetooth to communicate with your device.
You can use the `ToggleOutput`, `OutputUSB` or `OutputBluetooth` keycode to switch
between USB and Bluetooth. This won't disconnect your keyboard from your USB or Bluetooth
host. It will simply determine the device to send keyboard reports to.

# To-do List

- [ ] Multiple bluetooth profiles
- [ ] LE Secure Connections (I believe this requires `nrf-softdevice` changes)
- [ ] Automatic output selection
